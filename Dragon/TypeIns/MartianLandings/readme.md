# Instructions
This is a Lunar Lander style game. You drift down and left. 
Press UP and RIGHT arrows to fire retro thrusters.

# Comment
Rather than velocity when you hit the ground, this version relies on pixel detection of the landing pad which makes it feel a bit unfair sometimes.
Also you can crash into the sun!
That said it is a fun game and looks pretty good.

# Updates
Added fuel gauge.
Added screen mode change on crash.
Fixed low fuel warning sound so works on both key presses.
Fixed spelling mistakes in instructions.
Added title screen.
