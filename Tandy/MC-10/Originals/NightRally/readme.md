# Name
Night Rally

# Type
Game

# Description

You are in a night rally - stay on the road as long as you can!

# Source
This game was inspired by Night Driver from Games For Your Dragon by Clive Gifford 1983

I ended up writing my own game for the MC-10 for the text screen (original was PMODE4)
and I wanted to make the car actually move on screen.

# Instructions

Press Q for Left and P for Right to keep the car on the road.
